# Just-another-graphics-render-engine
This is just another graphics render engine. A way to force free electrons to go on a wild rollercoaster ride to hopefully make some  
not so free electrons jump up and down out of excitment so they create some photons. With a little luck these photons hit the sensors 
of a meaty vehicle, which will send other free electrons through an amazingly complex network of cells. With the right adjustments and 
extensions to the rollercoaster the production of the so called happy molecules will be increased to an satysfying amount.
